## Welcome
OWASP Bartlesville is the premier cybersecurity meetup in the Bartlesville area. If you are (or aspire to be) a computer professional or hacker and are interested in growing your skills, knowledge, and network, then this is the place you need to be. 

## Participation
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters Policy](/www-policy/operational/chapters). Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button. To be a SPEAKER at ANY OWASP Chapter in the world simply review the [speaker agreement](/www-policy/speaker-agreement) and then contact the local chapter leader with details of what OWASP Project, independent research, or related software security topic you would like to present.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our [Projects](/projects/), [Local Chapters](/chapters/), [Events](/events/), [Online Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/){:target='_blank'}, and [Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/){:target='_blank'}. We especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as an expert. We also encourage you to be [become a member](/membership/) or consider a [donation](/donate/) to support our ongoing work.
